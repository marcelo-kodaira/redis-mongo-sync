# 1. Using EventEmitter

## How It Works
The ChangeStream is treated as an EventEmitter.
You register an event listener on the change event to react when changes occur.
## Pros
Simple to Implement: Easy to set up and requires minimal boilerplate.
Real-Time Processing: Automatically reacts to events as they happen.
Low Overhead: Ideal for basic use cases with fewer changes.
## Cons
Lacks Control: No direct control over the flow of events.
Error Handling: Error handling might require more effort if the stream is not properly closed or fails.
Not Suitable for High Volume: Can struggle under high event throughput as it doesn't provide backpressure.
## When to Use
When building quick prototypes or monitoring lightweight workloads.
For applications where simplicity is a priority over fine-grained control.
# 2. Using hasNext()
## How It Works
Polls the change stream using the hasNext() method, waiting for the next change to arrive.
Each event is processed sequentially.
## Pros
Explicit Control: Provides more granular control over how and when events are processed.
Error Recovery: Easier to handle errors in a controlled loop.
Works Well for Low-Frequency Changes: Good for systems where changes occur less frequently.
## Cons
Polling Overhead: Not as efficient as event-driven models for high-frequency changes.
Sequential Processing: Cannot easily handle high-throughput or parallel processing of events.
## When to Use
When you need full control over the change stream's lifecycle.
For applications where changes are infrequent but require careful handling.
# 3. Using the Stream API
## How It Works
Converts the ChangeStream into a Node.js readable stream.
Pipes changes into a writable stream for continuous processing.
## Pros
Efficient for High Throughput: Handles a large volume of changes efficiently with built-in backpressure support.
Integrates with Other Streams: Can be combined with other stream-processing pipelines.
Scalable: Best suited for applications that process large amounts of data.
## Cons
Complexity: Slightly more complex to implement compared to EventEmitter.
Stream Handling: Requires understanding Node.js streams and their backpressure mechanisms.
## When to Use
When handling high-frequency changes in a scalable and efficient way.
For systems that need to integrate with other stream-based APIs or processing pipelines.
